        "content": " Incomputer networking, aproxy serveris aserver applicationthat acts as anintermediarybetween aclientrequesting aresourceand the server providing that resource.[1]It improves privacy, security, and performance in the process. Instead of connecting directly to a server that can fulfill a request for a resource, such as a file orweb page, the client directs the request to the proxy server, which evaluates the request and performs the required network transactions. This serves as a method to simplify or control the complexity of the request, or provide additional benefits such asload balancing, privacy, or security. Proxies were devised to add structure andencapsulationtodistributed systems.[2]A proxy server thus functions on behalf of the client when requesting service, potentially masking the true origin of the request to the resource server. A proxy server may reside on the user'slocal computer, or at any point between the user's computer and destination servers on theInternet. A proxy server that passes unmodified requests and responses is usually called agatewayor sometimes atunneling proxy. A forward proxy is an Internet-facing proxy used to retrieve data from a wide range of sources (in most cases, anywhere on the Internet). Areverse proxyis usually an internal-facing proxy used as a front-end to control and protect access to a server on a private network. A reverse proxy commonly also performs tasks such asload-balancing,authentication,decryptionandcaching.[3] Anopen proxyis aforwardingproxy server that is accessible by any Internet user. In 2008, network security expertGordon Lyonestimated that \"hundreds of thousands\" of open proxies are operated on the Internet.[4] A reverse proxy (or surrogate) is a proxy server that appears to clients to be an ordinary server. Reverse proxies forward requests to one or more ordinary servers that handle the request. The response from the original server is returned as if it came directly from the proxy server, leaving the client with no knowledge of the original server.[5]Reverse proxies are installed in the vicinity of one or more web servers. Alltraffic coming from the Internetand with a destination of one of the neighborhood's web servers goes through the proxy server. The use of \"reverse\" originates in its counterpart \"forward proxy\" since the reverse proxy sits closer to the web server and serves only a restricted set of websites. There are several reasons for installing reverse proxy servers: A reverse proxy mainly protects the server, while a forward proxy protects the client. Acontent-filteringweb proxy server provides administrative control over the content that may be relayed in one or both directions through the proxy. It is commonly used in both commercial and non-commercial organizations (especially schools) to ensure that Internet usage conforms toacceptable use policy. Content filtering proxy servers will often supportuser authenticationto control web access. It also usually produceslogs, either to give detailed information about the URLs accessed by specific users or to monitorbandwidthusage statistics. It may also communicate todaemon-based and/orICAP-based antivirus software to provide security against viruses and othermalwareby scanning incoming content in real-time before it enters the network. Many workplaces, schools, and colleges restrict web sites and online services that are accessible and available in their buildings. Governments also censor undesirable content. This is done either with a specialized proxy, called a content filter (both commercial and free products are available), or by using a cache-extension protocol such as ICAP, that allows plug-in extensions to an open caching architecture. Websites commonly used by students to circumvent filters and access blocked content often include a proxy, from which the user can then access the websites that the filter is trying to block. Requests may be filtered by several methods, such as aURLorDNS blacklists, URL regex filtering,MIMEfiltering, or content keyword filtering. Blacklists are often provided and maintained by web-filtering companies, often grouped into categories (pornography, gambling, shopping, social networks, etc..). The proxy then fetches the content, assuming the requested URL is acceptable. At this point, a dynamic filter may be applied on the return path. For example,JPEGfiles could be blocked based on fleshtone matches, or language filters could dynamically detect unwanted language. If the content is rejected then an HTTP fetch error may be returned to the requester. Most web filtering companies use an internet-wide crawling robot that assesses the likelihood that content is a certain type. Manual labor is used to correct the resultant database based on complaints or known flaws in the content-matching algorithms.[6] Some proxies scan outbound content, e.g., for data loss prevention; or scan content for malicious software. Web filtering proxies are not able to peer inside secure sockets HTTP transactions, assuming the chain-of-trust of SSL/TLS (Transport Layer Security) has not been tampered with. The SSL/TLS chain-of-trust relies on trusted rootcertificate authorities. In a workplace setting where the client is managed by the organization, devices may be configured to trust a root certificate whose private key is known to the proxy. In such situations, proxy analysis of the contents of an SSL/TLS transaction becomes possible. The proxy is effectively operating aman-in-the-middle attack, allowed by the client's trust of a root certificate the proxy owns. If the destination server filters content based on the origin of the request, the use of a proxy can circumvent this filter. For example, a server usingIP-basedgeolocationto restrict its service to a certain country can be accessed using a proxy located in that country to access the service.[7]: 3 Web proxies are the most common means of bypassing government censorship, although no more than 3% of Internet users use any circumvention tools.[7]: 7 Some proxy service providers allow businesses access to their proxy network for rerouting traffic for business intelligence purposes.[8] In some cases, users can circumvent proxies that filter using blacklists by using services designed to proxy information from a non-blacklisted location.[9] Proxies can be installed in order toeavesdropupon the data-flow between client machines and the web. All content sent or accessed – including passwords submitted andcookiesused – can be captured and analyzed by the proxy operator. For this reason, passwords to online services (such as webmail and banking) should always be exchanged over a cryptographically secured connection, such as SSL. By chaining the proxies which do not reveal data about the original requester, it is possible to obfuscate activities from the eyes of the user's destination. However, more traces will be left on the intermediate hops, which could be used or offered up to trace the user's activities. If the policies and administrators of these other proxies are unknown, the user may fall victim to a false sense of security just because those details are out of sight and mind. In what is more of an inconvenience than a risk, proxy users may find themselves being blocked from certain Web sites, as numerous forums and Web sitesblock IP addressesfrom proxies known to havespammedortrolledthe site. Proxy bouncing can be used to maintain privacy. Acaching proxyserver accelerates service requests by retrieving the content saved from a previous request made by the same client or even other clients.[10]Caching proxies keep local copies of frequently requested resources, allowing large organizations to significantly reduce their upstream bandwidth usage and costs, while significantly increasing performance. Most ISPs and large businesses have a caching proxy. Caching proxies were the first kind of proxy server. Web proxies are commonly used tocacheweb pages from a web server.[11]Poorly implemented caching proxies can cause problems, such as an inability to use user authentication.[12] A proxy that is designed to mitigate specific link related issues or degradation is aPerformance Enhancing Proxy(PEPs). These are typically used to improveTCPperformance in the presence of high round-trip times or high packet loss (such as wireless or mobile phone networks); or highly asymmetric links featuring very different upload and download rates. PEPs can make more efficient use of the network, for example, by merging TCPACKs(acknowledgements) or compressing data sent at theapplication layer.[13] A translation proxy is a proxy server that is used to localize a website experience for different markets. Traffic from the global audience is routed through the translation proxy to the source website. As visitors browse the proxied site, requests go back to the source site where pages are rendered. The original language content in the response is replaced by the translated content as it passes back through the proxy. The translations used in a translation proxy can be either machine translation, human translation, or a combination of machine and human translation. Different translation proxy implementations have different capabilities. Some allow further customization of the source site for the local audiences such as excluding the source content or substituting the source content with the original local content. An anonymous proxy server (sometimes called a web proxy) generally attempts to anonymize web surfing.Anonymizersmay be differentiated into several varieties. The destination server (the server that ultimately satisfies the web request) receives requests from the anonymizing proxy server and thus does not receive information about the end user's address. The requests are not anonymous to the anonymizing proxy server, however, and so a degree of trust is present between the proxy server and the user. Many proxy servers are funded through a continued advertising link to the user. Access control: Some proxy servers implement a logon requirement. In large organizations, authorized users must log on to gain access to theweb. The organization can thereby track usage to individuals. Some anonymizing proxy servers may forwarddata packetswith header lines such as HTTP_VIA, HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR, or HTTP_FORWARDED, which may reveal the IP address of the client. Other anonymizing proxy servers, known as elite or high-anonymity proxies, make it appear that the proxy server is the client. A website could still suspect a proxy is being used if the client sends packets that include a cookie from a previous visit that did not use the high-anonymity proxy server. Clearing cookies, and possibly the cache, would solve this problem. Advertisers use proxy servers for validating, checking and quality assurance ofgeotargeted ads. A geotargeting ad server checks the request source IP address and uses ageo-IP databaseto determine the geographic source of requests.[14]Using a proxy server that is physically located inside a specific country or a city gives advertisers the ability to test geotargeted ads. A proxy can keep the internal network structure of a company secret by usingnetwork address translation, which can help thesecurityof the internal network.[15]This makes requests from machines and users on the local network anonymous. Proxies can also be combined withfirewalls. An incorrectly configured proxy can provide access to a network otherwise isolated from the Internet.[4] Proxies allow web sites to make web requests to externally hosted resources (e.g. images, music files, etc.) whencross-domain restrictionsprohibit the web site from linking directly to the outside domains. Proxies also allow the browser to make web requests to externally hosted content on behalf of a website when cross-domain restrictions (in place to protect websites from the likes of data theft) prohibit the browser from directly accessing the outside domains. Secondary market brokers use web proxy servers to circumvent restrictions on online purchase of limited products such as limited sneakers[16]or tickets. Web proxies forwardHTTPrequests. The request from the client is the same as aregular HTTP requestexcept the full URL is passed, instead of just the path.[17] This request is sent to the proxy server, the proxy makes the request specified and returns the response. Some web proxies allow theHTTP CONNECTmethod to set up forwarding of arbitrary data through the connection; a common policy is to only forward port 443 to allowHTTPStraffic. Examples of web proxy servers includeApache(withmod_proxyorTraffic Server),HAProxy,IISconfigured as proxy (e.g., with Application Request Routing),Nginx,Privoxy,Squid,Varnish(reverse proxy only),WinGate,Ziproxy, Tinyproxy, RabbIT andPolipo. For clients, the problem of complex or multiple proxy-servers is solved by a client-serverProxy auto-configprotocol (PAC file). SOCKSalso forwards arbitrary data after a connection phase, and is similar to HTTP CONNECT in web proxies. Also known as anintercepting proxy,inline proxy, orforced proxy, a transparent proxy intercepts normalapplication layercommunication without requiring any special client configuration. Clients need not be aware of the existence of the proxy. A transparent proxy is normally located between the client and the Internet, with the proxy performing some of the functions of agatewayorrouter.[18] RFC2616(Hypertext Transfer Protocol—HTTP/1.1) offers standard definitions: \"A 'transparent proxy' is a proxy that does not modify the request or response beyond what is required for proxy authentication and identification\". \"A 'non-transparent proxy' is a proxy that modifies the request or response in order to provide some added service to the user agent, such as group annotation services, media type transformation, protocol reduction, or anonymity filtering\". TCP Intercept is a traffic filtering security feature that protects TCP servers from TCPSYN floodattacks, which are a type of denial-of-service attack. TCP Intercept is available for IP traffic only. In 2009 a security flaw in the way that transparent proxies operate was published by Robert Auger,[19]and the Computer Emergency Response Team issued an advisory listing dozens of affected transparent and intercepting proxy servers.[20] Intercepting proxies are commonly used in businesses to enforce acceptable use policies and to ease administrative overheads since no client browser configuration is required. This second reason, however is mitigated by features such as Active Directory group policy, orDHCPand automatic proxy detection. Intercepting proxies are also commonly used by ISPs in some countries to save upstream bandwidth and improve customer response times by caching. This is more common in countries where bandwidth is more limited (e.g. island nations) or must be paid for. The diversion or interception of a TCP connection creates several issues. First, the original destination IP and port must somehow be communicated to the proxy. This is not always possible (e.g., where the gateway and proxy reside on different hosts). There is a class ofcross-site attacksthat depend on certain behaviors of intercepting proxies that do not check or have access to information about the original (intercepted) destination. This problem may be resolved by using an integrated packet-level and application level appliance or software which is then able to communicate this information between the packet handler and the proxy. Intercepting also creates problems forHTTPauthentication, especially connection-oriented authentication such asNTLM, as the client browser believes it is talking to a server rather than a proxy. This can cause problems where an intercepting proxy requires authentication, and then the user connects to a site that also requires authentication. Finally, intercepting connections can cause problems for HTTP caches, as some requests and responses become uncacheable by a shared cache. In integrated firewall/proxy servers where the router/firewall is on the same host as the proxy, communicating original destination information can be done by any method, for exampleMicrosoft TMGorWinGate. Interception can also be performed using Cisco'sWCCP(Web Cache Control Protocol). This proprietary protocol resides on the router and is configured from the cache, allowing the cache to determine what ports and traffic is sent to it via transparent redirection from the router. This redirection can occur in one of two ways:GRE tunneling(OSI Layer 3) or MAC rewrites (OSI Layer 2). Once traffic reaches the proxy machine itself, interception is commonly performed with NAT (Network Address Translation). Such setups are invisible to the client browser, but leave the proxy visible to the web server and other devices on the internet side of the proxy. Recent Linux and some BSD releases provide TPROXY (transparent proxy) which performs IP-level (OSI Layer 3) transparent interception and spoofing of outbound traffic, hiding the proxy IP address from other network devices. Several methods may be used to detect the presence of an intercepting proxy server: ACGIweb proxy accepts target URLs using aWeb formin the user's browser window, processes the request, and returns the results to the user's browser. Consequently, it can be used on a device or network that does not allow \"true\" proxy settings to be changed. The first recorded CGI proxy, named \"rover\" at the time but renamed in 1998 to \"CGIProxy\",[23]was developed by American computer scientist James Marshall in early 1996 for an article in \"Unix Review\" by Rich Morin.[24] The majority of CGI proxies are powered by one of CGIProxy (written in thePerllanguage), Glype (written in thePHPlanguage), or PHProxy (written in the PHP language). As of April 2016, CGIProxy has received about two million downloads, Glype has received almost a million downloads,[25]whilst PHProxy still receives hundreds of downloads per week.[26]Despite waning in popularity[27]due toVPNsand other privacy methods, as of September 2021[update]there are still a few hundred CGI proxies online.[28] Some CGI proxies were set up for purposes such asmaking websites more accessibleto disabled people, but have since been shut down due toexcessive traffic, usually caused by athird party advertising the serviceas a means to bypass local filtering. Since many of these users do not care about the collateral damage they are causing, it became necessary for organizations to hide their proxies, disclosing the URLs only to those who take the trouble to contact the organization and demonstrate a genuine need.[29] A suffix proxy allows a user to access web content by appending the name of the proxy server to the URL of the requested content (e.g. \"en.wikipedia.org.SuffixProxy.com\"). Suffix proxy servers are easier to use than regular proxy servers, but they do not offer high levels of anonymity, and their primary use is for bypassing web filters. However, this is rarely used due to more advanced web filters. Toris a system intended to provideonline anonymity.[30]Tor client software routes Internet traffic through a worldwide volunteer network of servers for concealing a user's computer location or usage from someone conductingnetwork surveillanceortraffic analysis. Using Tor makes tracing Internet activity more difficult,[30]and is intended to protect users' personal freedom and their online privacy. \"Onion routing\" refers to the layered nature of the encryption service: The original data are encrypted and re-encrypted multiple times, then sent through successive Tor relays, each one of which decrypts a \"layer\" of encryption before passing the data on to the next relay and ultimately the destination. This reduces the possibility of the original data being unscrambled or understood in transit.[31] TheI2P anonymous network('I2P') is a proxy network aiming atonline anonymity. It implementsgarlic routing, which is an enhancement of Tor's onion routing. I2P is fully distributed and works by encrypting all communications in various layers and relaying them through a network of routers run by volunteers in various locations. By keeping the source of the information hidden, I2P offers censorship resistance. The goals of I2P are to protect users' personal freedom, privacy, and ability to conduct confidential business. Each user of I2P runs an I2P router on their computer (node). The I2P router takes care of finding other peers and building anonymizing tunnels through them. I2P provides proxies for all protocols (HTTP,IRC, SOCKS, ...). The proxy concept refers to a layer 7 application in theOSI reference model.Network address translation(NAT) is similar to a proxy but operates in layer 3. In the client configuration of layer-3 NAT, configuring the gateway is sufficient. However, for the client configuration of a layer 7 proxy, the destination of the packets that the client generates must always be the proxy server (layer 7), then the proxy server reads each packet and finds out the true destination. Because NAT operates at layer-3, it is less resource-intensive than the layer-7 proxy, but also less flexible. As we compare these two technologies, we might encounter a terminology known as 'transparent firewall'.Transparent firewallmeans that the proxy uses the layer-7 proxy advantages without the knowledge of the client. The client presumes that the gateway is a NAT in layer 3, and it does not have any idea about the inside of the packet, but through this method, the layer-3 packets are sent to the layer-7 proxy for investigation.[citation needed] ADNSproxy server takes DNS queries from a (usually local) network and forwards them to an Internet Domain Name Server. It may also cache DNS records. Some client programs \"SOCKS-ify\" requests,[32]which allows adaptation of any networked software to connect to external networks via certain types of proxy servers (mostly SOCKS). A residential proxy is an intermediary that uses a real IP address provided by anInternet Service Provider (ISP)with physical devices such asmobilesandcomputers of end-users. Instead of connecting directly to aserver, residential proxy users connect to the target through residential IP addresses. The target then identifies them as organic internet users. It does not let any tracking tool identify the reallocation of the user.[33]Any residential proxy can send any number of concurrent requests, and IP addresses are directly related to a specific region.[34]Unlike regular residential proxies, which hide the user's real IP address behind another IP address, rotating residential proxies, also known asbackconnect proxies, conceal the user's real IP address behind a pool of proxies. These proxies switch between themselves at every session or at regular intervals.[35] Despite the providers assertion that the proxy hosts are voluntarily participating, numerous proxies are operated on potentially compromised hosts, includingInternet of thingsdevices. Through the process of cross-referencing the hosts, researchers have identified and analyzed logs that have been classified aspotentially unwanted programand exposed a range of unauthorized activities conducted by RESIP hosts. These activities encompassed illegal promotion, fast fluxing, phishing, hosting malware, and more.[36]",

        "content": "Web scraping,web harvesting, orweb data extractionisdata scrapingused forextracting datafromwebsites.[1]Web scraping software may directly access theWorld Wide Webusing theHypertext Transfer Protocolor a web browser. While web scraping can be done manually by a software user, the term typically refers to automated processes implemented using abotorweb crawler. It is a form of copying in which specific data is gathered and copied from the web, typically into a central localdatabaseor spreadsheet, for laterretrievaloranalysis. Scraping a web page involves fetching it and extracting from it. Fetching is the downloading of a page (which a browser does when a user views a page). Therefore, web crawling is a main component of web scraping, to fetch pages for later processing. Once fetched, extraction can take place. The content of a page may beparsed, searched and reformatted, and its data copied into a spreadsheet or loaded into a database. Web scrapers typically take something out of a page, to make use of it for another purpose somewhere else. An example would be finding and copying names and telephone numbers, companies and their URLs, or e-mail addresses to a list (contact scraping). As well ascontact scraping, web scraping is used as a component of applications used forweb indexing,web mininganddata mining, online price change monitoring andprice comparison, product review scraping (to watch the competition), gathering real estate listings, weather data monitoring,website change detection, research, tracking online presence and reputation,web mashup, andweb data integration. Web pagesare built using text-based mark-up languages (HTMLandXHTML), and frequently contain a wealth of useful data in text form. However, most web pages are designed for humanend-usersand not for ease of automated use. As a result, specialized tools and software have been developed to facilitate the scraping of web pages. Newer forms of web scraping involve monitoring data feeds from web servers.  For example,JSONis commonly used as a transport mechanism between the client and the web server. There are methods that some websites use to prevent web scraping, such as detecting and disallowing bots from crawling (viewing) their pages. In response, there are web scraping systems that rely on using techniques inDOMparsing,computer visionandnatural language processingto simulate human browsing to enable gathering web page content for offline parsing Web scraping is the process of automatically mining data or collecting information from the World Wide Web. It is a field with active developments sharing a common goal with thesemantic webvision, an ambitious initiative that still requires breakthroughs in text processing, semantic understanding, artificial intelligence andhuman-computer interactions. The simplest form of web scraping is manually copying and pasting data from a web page into a text file or spreadsheet. Sometimes even the best web-scraping technology cannot replace a human's manual examination and copy-and-paste, and sometimes this may be the only workable solution when the websites for scraping explicitly set up barriers to prevent machine automation. A simple yet powerful approach to extract information from web pages can be based on the UNIXgrepcommand orregular expression-matching facilities of programming languages (for instancePerlorPython). Staticanddynamic web pagescan be retrieved by posting HTTP requests to the remote web server usingsocket programming. Many websites have large collections of pages generated dynamically from an underlying structured source like a database. Data of the same category are typically encoded into similar pages by a common script or template. In data mining, a program that detects such templates in a particular information source, extracts its content, and translates it into a relational form, is called awrapper. Wrapper generation algorithms assume that input pages of a wrapper induction system conform to a common template and that they can be easily identified in terms of a URL common scheme.[3]Moreover, somesemi-structured dataquery languages, such asXQueryand the HTQL, can be used to parse HTML pages and to retrieve and transform page content. By embedding a full-fledged web browser, such as theInternet Exploreror theMozillabrowser control, programs can retrieve the dynamic content generated by client-side scripts. These browser controls also parse web pages into a DOM tree, based on which programs can retrieve parts of the pages. Languages such asXpathcan be used to parse the resulting DOM tree. There are several companies that have developed vertical specific harvesting platforms. These platforms create and monitor a multitude of \"bots\" for specific verticals with no \"man in the loop\" (no direct human involvement), and no work related to a specific target site. The preparation involves establishing the knowledge base for the entire vertical and then the platform creates the bots automatically. The platform's robustness is measured by the quality of the information it retrieves (usually number of fields) and its scalability (how quick it can scale up to hundreds or thousands of sites). This scalability is mostly used to target theLong Tailof sites that common aggregators find complicated or too labor-intensive to harvest content from. The pages being scraped may embracemetadataor semantic markups and annotations, which can be used to locate specific data snippets. If the annotations are embedded in the pages, asMicroformatdoes, this technique can be viewed as a special case of DOM parsing. In another case, the annotations, organized into a semantic layer,[4]are stored and managed separately from the web pages, so the scrapers can retrieve data schema and instructions from this layer before scraping the pages. There are efforts usingmachine learningandcomputer visionthat attempt to identify and extract information from web pages by interpreting pages visually as a human being might.[5] There are many software tools available that can be used to customize web-scraping solutions. This software may attempt to automatically recognize the data structure of a page or provide a recording interface that removes the necessity to manually write web-scraping code, or some scripting functions that can be used to extract and transform content, and database interfaces that can store the scraped data in local databases. Some web scraping software can also be used to extract data from an API directly, others allow to acquire data from websites based on AJAX (with dynamic loading of content) or ones that require a login. Point-and-click software allow individuals who may not have advanced coding skills to benefit from web scraping.[6] The legality of web scraping varies across the world. In general, web scraping may be against theterms of serviceof some websites, but the enforceability of these terms is unclear.[7] In the United States, website owners can use three majorlegal claimsto prevent undesired web scraping: (1) copyright infringement (compilation), (2) violation of theComputer Fraud and Abuse Act(\"CFAA\"), and (3)trespass to chattel.[8]However, the effectiveness of these claims relies upon meeting various criteria, and the case law is still evolving. For example, with regard to copyright, while outright duplication of original expression will in many cases be illegal, in the United States the courts ruled inFeist Publications v. Rural Telephone Servicethat duplication of facts is allowable. U.S. courts have acknowledged that users of \"scrapers\" or \"robots\" may be held liable for committingtrespass to chattels,[9][10]which involves a computer system itself being considered personal property upon which the user of a scraper is trespassing. The best known of these cases,eBay v. Bidder's Edge, resulted in an injunction ordering Bidder's Edge to stop accessing, collecting, and indexing auctions from the eBay web site. This case involved automatic placing of bids, known asauction sniping. However, in order to succeed on a claim of trespass tochattels, theplaintiffmust demonstrate that thedefendantintentionally and without authorization interfered with the plaintiff's possessory interest in the computer system and that the defendant's unauthorized use caused damage to the plaintiff. Not all cases of web spidering brought before the courts have been considered trespass to chattels.[11] One of the first major tests ofscreen scrapinginvolvedAmerican Airlines(AA), and a firm called FareChase.[12]AA successfully obtained aninjunctionfrom a Texas trial court, stopping FareChase from selling software that enables users to compare online fares if the software also searches AA's website. The airline argued that FareChase's websearch software trespassed on AA's servers when it collected the publicly available data. FareChase filed an appeal in March 2003. By June, FareChase and AA agreed to settle and the appeal was dropped.[13] Southwest Airlineshas also challenged screen-scraping practices, and has involved both FareChase and another firm, Outtask, in a legal claim. Southwest Airlines charged that the screen-scraping is Illegal since it is an example of \"Computer Fraud and Abuse\" and has led to \"Damage and Loss\" and \"Unauthorized Access\" of Southwest's site. It also constitutes \"Interference with Business Relations\", \"Trespass\", and \"Harmful Access by Computer\". They also claimed that screen-scraping constitutes what is legally known as \"Misappropriation and Unjust Enrichment\", as well as being a breach of the web site's user agreement. Outtask denied all these claims, claiming that the prevailing law, in this case, should beUS Copyright lawand that under copyright, the pieces of information being scraped would not be subject to copyright protection. Although the cases were never resolved in theSupreme Court of the United States, FareChase was eventually shuttered by parent companyYahoo!, and Outtask was purchased by travel expense company Concur.[14]In 2012, a startup called 3Taps scraped classified housing ads from Craigslist. Craigslist sent 3Taps a cease-and-desist letter and blocked their IP addresses and later sued, inCraigslist v. 3Taps. The court held that the cease-and-desist letter and IP blocking was sufficient for Craigslist to properly claim that 3Taps had violated theComputer Fraud and Abuse Act(CFAA). Although these are early scraping decisions, and the theories of liability are not uniform, it is difficult to ignore a pattern emerging that the courts are prepared to protect proprietary content on commercial sites from uses which are undesirable to the owners of such sites. However, the degree of protection for such content is not settled and will depend on the type of access made by the scraper, the amount of information accessed and copied, the degree to which the access adversely affects the site owner's system and the types and manner of prohibitions on such conduct.[15] While the law in this area becomes more settled, entities contemplating using scraping programs to access a public web site should also consider whether such action is authorized by reviewing the terms of use and other terms or notices posted on or made available through the site. In a 2010 ruling in theCvent, Inc.v.Eventbrite, Inc.In the United States district court for the eastern district of Virginia, the court ruled that the terms of use should be brought to the users' attention In order for abrowse wrapcontract or license to be enforced.[16]In a 2014 case, filed in theUnited States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania,[17]e-commerce siteQVCobjected to the Pinterest-like shopping aggregator Resultly's 'scraping of QVC's site for real-time pricing data. QVC alleges that Resultly \"excessively crawled\" QVC's retail site (allegedly sending 200-300 search requests to QVC's website per minute, sometimes to up to 36,000 requests per minute) which caused QVC's site to crash for two days, resulting in lost sales for QVC.[18]QVC's complaint alleges that the defendant disguised its web crawler to mask its source IP address and thus prevented QVC from quickly repairing the problem. This is a particularly interesting scraping case because QVC is seeking damages for the unavailability of their website, which QVC claims was caused by Resultly. In the plaintiff's web site during the period of this trial, the terms of use link are displayed among all the links of the site, at the bottom of the page as most sites on the internet. This ruling contradicts the Irish ruling described below. The court also rejected the plaintiff's argument that the browse-wrap restrictions were enforceable in view of Virginia's adoption of the Uniform Computer Information Transactions Act (UCITA)—a uniform law that many believed was in favor on common browse-wrap contracting practices.[19] InFacebook, Inc. v. Power Ventures, Inc., a district court ruled in 2012 that Power Ventures could not scrape Facebook pages on behalf of a Facebook user. The case is on appeal, and theElectronic Frontier Foundationfiled a brief in 2015 asking that it be overturned.[20][21]InAssociated Press v. Meltwater U.S. Holdings, Inc., a court in the US held Meltwater liable for scraping and republishing news information from the Associated Press, but a court in the United Kingdom held in favor of Meltwater. TheNinth Circuitruled in 2019 that web scraping did not violate the CFAA inhiQ Labs v. LinkedIn. The case was appealed to theUnited States Supreme Court, which returned the case to the Ninth Circuit to reconsider the case in light of the 2021 Supreme Court decision inVan Buren v. United Stateswhich narrowed the applicability of the CFAA.[22]On this review, the Ninth Circuit upheld their prior decision.[23] Internet Archivecollects and distributes a significant number of publicly available web pages without being considered to be in violation of copyright laws.[citation needed] In February 2006, theDanish Maritime and Commercial Court(Copenhagen) ruled that systematic crawling, indexing, and deep linking by portal site ofir.dk of real estate site Home.dk does not conflict with Danish law or the database directive of the European Union.[24] In a February 2010 case complicated by matters of jurisdiction, Ireland's High Court delivered a verdict that illustrates theinchoatestate of developing case law. In the case ofRyanair Ltd v Billigfluege.de GmbH, Ireland's High Court ruledRyanair's\"click-wrap\" agreement to be legally binding. In contrast to the findings of the United States District Court Eastern District of Virginia and those of the Danish Maritime and Commercial Court, JusticeMichael Hannaruled that the hyperlink to Ryanair's terms and conditions was plainly visible, and that placing the onus on the user to agree to terms and conditions in order to gain access to online services is sufficient to comprise a contractual relationship.[25]The decision is under appeal in Ireland's Supreme Court.[26] On April 30, 2020, the French Data Protection Authority (CNIL) released new guidelines on web scraping.[27]The CNIL guidelines made it clear that publicly available data is still personal data and cannot be repurposed without the knowledge of the person to whom that data belongs.[28] In Australia, theSpam Act 2003outlaws some forms of web harvesting, although this only applies to email addresses.[29][30] Leaving a few cases dealing with IPR infringement, Indian courts have not expressly ruled on the legality of web scraping. However, since all common forms of electronic contracts are enforceable in India, violating the terms of use prohibiting data scraping will be a violation of the contract law. It will also violate theInformation Technology Act, 2000, which penalizes unauthorized access to a computer resource or extracting data from a computer resource. The administrator of a website can use various measures to stop or slow a bot. Some techniques include:",

        "content": "Data engineeringrefers to the building ofsystemsto enable the collection and usage ofdata. This data is usually used to enable subsequentanalysisanddata science; which often involvesmachine learning.[1][2]Making the data usable usually involves substantialcomputeandstorage, as well asdata processing. Around the 1970s/1980s the terminformation engineering methodology(IEM) was created to describedatabase designand the use ofsoftwarefor data analysis and processing.[3][4]These techniques were intended to be used bydatabase administrators(DBAs) and bysystems analystsbased upon an understanding of the operational processing needs of organizations for the 1980s. In particular, these techniques were meant to help bridge the gap between strategic business planning and information systems. A key early contributor (often called the \"father\" of information engineering methodology) was the AustralianClive Finkelstein, who wrote several articles about it between 1976 and 1980, and also co-authored an influentialSavant Institutereport on it with James Martin.[5][6][7]Over the next few years, Finkelstein continued work in a more business-driven direction, which was intended to address a rapidly changing business environment; Martin continued work in a more data processing-driven direction. From 1983 to 1987, Charles M. Richter, guided by Clive Finkelstein, played a significant role in revamping IEM as well as helping to design the IEM software product (user data), which helped automate IEM. In the early 2000s, the data and data tooling was generally held by theinformation technology(IT) teams in most companies.[8]Other teams then used data for their work (e.g. reporting), and there was usually little overlap in data skillset between these parts of the business. In the early 2010s, with the rise of theinternet, the massive increase in data volumes, velocity, and variety led to the termbig datato describe the data itself, and data-driven tech companies likeFacebookandAirbnbstarted using the phrasedata engineer.[3][8]Due to the new scale of the data, major firms likeGoogle, Facebook,Amazon,Apple,Microsoft, andNetflixstarted to move away from traditionalETLand storage techniques. They started creatingdata engineering, a type ofsoftware engineeringfocused on data, and in particularinfrastructure,warehousing,data protection,cybersecurity,mining,modelling,processing, andmetadatamanagement.[3][8]This change in approach was particularly focused oncloud computing.[8]Data started to be handled and used by many parts of the business, such assalesandmarketing, and not just IT.[8] High-performance computing is critical for the processing and analysis of data. One particularly widespread approach to computing for data engineering isdataflow programming, in which the computation is represented as adirected graph(dataflow graph); nodes are the operations, and edges represent the flow of data.[9]Popular implementations includeApache Spark, and thedeep learningspecificTensorFlow.[9][10][11]More recent implementations, such asDifferential/TimelyDataflow, have usedincremental computingfor much more efficient data processing.[9][12][13] Data is stored in a variety of ways, one of the key deciding factors is in how the data will be used. Data engineers optimize data storage and processing systems to reduce costs. They use data compression, partitioning, and archiving. If the data is structured and some form ofonline transaction processingis required, thendatabasesare generally used.[14]Originally mostlyrelational databaseswere used, with strongACIDtransaction correctness guarantees; most relational databases useSQLfor their queries. However, with the growth of data in the 2010s,NoSQLdatabases have also become popular since theyhorizontally scaledmore easily than relational databases by giving up the ACID transaction guarantees, as well as reducing theobject-relational impedance mismatch.[15]More recently,NewSQLdatabases — which attempt to allow horizontal scaling while retaining ACID guarantees — have become popular.[16][17][18][19] If the data is structured andonline analytical processingis required (but not online transaction processing), thendata warehousesare a main choice.[20]They enable data analysis, mining, andartificial intelligenceon a much larger scale than databases can allow,[20]and indeed data often flow from databases into data warehouses.[21]Business analysts, data engineers, and data scientists can access data warehouses using tools such as SQL orbusiness intelligencesoftware.[21] Adata lakeis a centralized repository for storing, processing, and securing large volumes of data. A data lake can containstructured datafromrelational databases,semi-structured data,unstructured data, andbinary data. A data lake can be created on premises or in a cloud-based environment using the services frompublic cloudvendors such asAmazon,Microsoft, orGoogle. If the data is less structured, then often they are just stored asfiles. There are several options: The number and variety of different data processes and storage locations can become overwhelming for users. This inspired the usage of aworkflow management system(e.g.Airflow) to allow the data tasks to be specified, created, and monitored.[24]The tasks are often specified as adirected acyclic graph (DAG).[24] Business objectives that executives set for what's to come are characterized in key business plans, with their more noteworthy definition in tactical business plans and implementation in operational business plans. Most businesses today recognize the fundamental need to grow a business plan that follows this strategy. It is often difficult to implement these plans because of the lack of transparency at the tactical and operational degrees of organizations. This kind of planning requires feedback to allow for early correction of problems that are due to miscommunication and misinterpretation of the business plan. The design of data systems involves several components such as architecting data platforms, and designing data stores.[25][26] This is the process of producing adata model, anabstract modelto describe the data and relationships between different parts of the data.[27] Adata engineeris a type of software engineer who createsbig dataETLpipelines to manage the flow of data through the organization. This makes it possible to take huge amounts of data and translate it intoinsights.[28]They are focused on the production readiness of data and things like formats, resilience, scaling, and security. Data engineers usually hail from a software engineering background and are proficient in programming languages likeJava,Python,Scala, andRust.[29][3]They will be more familiar with databases, architecture, cloud computing, andAgile software development.[3] Data scientistsare more focused on the analysis of the data, they will be more familiar withmathematics,algorithms,statistics, andmachine learning.[3][30]",

        "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media",
        "content": "Social mediaare interactive technologies that facilitate thecreation,sharingandaggregationofcontent, ideas, interests, and other forms of expression throughvirtual communitiesandnetworks.[1][2]Common features include:[2] The termsocialin regard to media suggests platforms enable communal activity. Social media can enhance and extend human networks.[6]Users access social media throughweb-based appsor custom apps on mobile devices. These interactive platforms allow individuals, communities, and organizations to share, co-create, discuss, participate in, and modify user-generated or self-curated content.[7][5][1]Social media are used to document memories, learn, and form friendships.[8]They may be used to promote people, companies, products, and ideas.[8]Social media can be used to consume, publish, or sharenews. Popular social media platforms with more than 100 million registered users includeX,Facebook,WeChat,ShareChat,Instagram,Pinterest,QZone,Weibo,VK,Tumblr,Baidu Tieba, andLinkedIn. Depending on interpretation, other popular platforms that are sometimes referred to as social media services includeYouTube,Letterboxd,QQ,Quora,Telegram,WhatsApp,Signal,LINE,Snapchat,Pinterest,Viber,Reddit,Discord,TikTok,Microsoft Teams.Wikisare examples of collaborative content creation. Social media outlets differ fromold media(e.g.newspapers,TV, andradio broadcasting) in many ways, including quality,[9]reach,frequency, usability, relevancy, and permanence.[10]Social media outlets operate in adialogictransmission system (many sources to many receivers) while traditional media operate under amonologictransmission model (one source to many receivers). For instance, a newspaper is delivered to many subscribers, and a radio station broadcasts the same programs to a city.[11] Observers have noted a range of positive and negative impacts from social media. Social media can help to improve an individual's sense of connectedness with others and be an effective communication (ormarketing) tool for corporations, entrepreneurs,non-profit organizations,advocacy groups, political parties, and governments. Social movements use social media for communicating and organizing. Social media has been criticized for a range of negative impacts on children and teenagers, including exposure to inappropriate content, exploitation by adults, sleep problems, attention problems, feelings of exclusion, and various mental health maladies.[12][13] ThePLATO systemwas launched in 1960 at theUniversity of Illinoisand subsequently commercially marketed byControl Data Corporation. It offered early forms of social media features with innovations such as Notes, PLATO's message-forum application; TERM-talk, its instant-messaging feature;Talkomatic, perhaps the firstonline chat room; News Report, acrowdsourcedonline newspaper, and blog and Access Lists, enabling the owner of a note file or other application to limit access to a certain set of users, for example, only friends, classmates, or co-workers. ARPANET, which came online in 1967, had by the late 1970s enabled exchange of non-government/business ideas and communication, as evidenced by thenetwork etiquette(or \"netiquette\") described in a 1982 handbook on computing atMIT'sArtificial Intelligence Laboratory.[14]ARPANET evolved into theInternetin the 1990s.[15]Usenet, conceived byTom TruscottandJim Ellisin 1979 at theUniversity of North Carolina at Chapel HillandDuke University, was the first open social media app, established in 1980. A precursor of the electronicbulletin board system(BBS), known asCommunity Memory, appeared by 1973. Mainstream BBSs arrived with the Computer Bulletin Board System in Chicago, which launched on February 16, 1978. Before long, most major US cities had more than one BBS, running onTRS-80,Apple II,Atari,IBM PC,Commodore 64,Sinclair, and similarpersonal computers.CompuServe,Prodigy, andAOLwere three of the largest BBS companies and were the first to migrate to the Internet in the 1990s. Between the mid-1980s and the mid-1990s, BBSes numbered in the tens of thousands in North America alone.[16]Message forums were the signature BBS phenomenon throughout the 1980s and early 1990s. In 1991,Tim Berners-LeeintegratedHTMLhypertextsoftware with the Internet, creating the World Wide Web. This breakthrough led to an explosion ofblogs,list servers, andemailservices. Message forums migrated to the web, and evolved intoInternet forums, supported by cheaper access as well as the ability to handle far more people simultaneously. These early text-based systems expanded to include images and video in the 21st century, aided bydigital camerasandcamera phones.[17] The evolution of online services progressed from serving as channels for networked communication to becoming interactive platforms for networked social interaction with the advent ofWeb 2.0.[6] Social media started in the mid-1990s with the invention of platforms likeGeoCities,Classmates.com, andSixDegrees.com.[18]While instant messaging and chat clients existed at the time, SixDegrees was unique as it was the first online service designed for people to connect using their actual names instead of anonymously. It boasted features like profiles, friends lists, and school affiliations, making it \"the very first social networking site\".[18][19]The platform's name was inspired by the \"six degrees of separation\" concept, which suggests that every person on the planet is just six connections away from everyone else.[20] In the early 2000s, social media platforms gained widespread popularity with the likes ofFriendsterandMyspace, followed byFacebook,YouTube, andX.[21] Research from 2015 reported that globally, users spent 22% of their online time on social networks,[22]likely fueled by the availability of smartphones.[23]As of 2023 as many as 4.76 billion people used social media[24]some 59% of the global population. A 2015 review identified four features unique to social media services:[2] In 2019,Merriam-Websterdefined social media as \"forms of electronic communication (such as websites for social networking and microblogging) through which users create online communities to share information, ideas, personal messages, and other content (such as videos).\"[25] Social media encompasses an expanding suite of services:[26] Some services offer more than one type of service.[5] Mobile social media refers to the use of social media onmobile devicessuch asphonesandtablets. It is distinguished by its ubiquity, since users no longer have to be at desk in order to participate on a computer. Mobile services can further make use of the user's immediate location to offer information, connections, or services relevant to that location. According toAndreas Kaplan, mobile social media activities fall among four types:[27] Certaincontenthas the potential to spreadvirally, an analogy for the wayviral infectionsspread contagiously from individual to individual. One user spreads a post across their network, which leads those users to follow suit. A post from a relatively unknown user can reach vast numbers of people within hours. Virality is not guaranteed; few posts make the transition. Viral marketingcampaigns are particularly attractive tobusinessesbecause they can achieve widespread advertising coverage at a fraction of the cost of traditional marketing campaigns.Nonprofit organizationsandactivistsmay also attempt to spread content virally. Social media sites provide specific functionality to help users re-share content, such as X's andFacebook's \"like\" option.[28] Bots are automated programs that operate on theinternet.[29]They automate many communication tasks. This has led to the creation of an industry of bot providers.[30] Chatbotsandsocial botsare programmed to mimic human interactions such as liking, commenting, and following.[31]Bots have also been developed to facilitatesocial media marketing.[32]Bots have led themarketing industryinto an analytical crisis, as bots make it difficult to differentiate between human interactions and bot interactions.[33]Some bots violate platforms'terms of use, which can result in bans and campaigns to eliminate bots categorically.[34]Bots may even pose as real people to avoid prohibitions.[35] 'Cyborgs'—either bot-assisted humans or human-assisted bots[35]—are used for both legitimate and illegitimate purposes, from spreadingfake newsto creatingmarketing buzz.[36][37][38]A common use claimed to be legitimate includes posting at a specific time.[39]A human writes a post content and the bot posts it a specific time. In other cases, cyborgs spread fake news.[35]Cyborgs may work assock puppets, where one human pretends to be someone else, or operates multiple accounts, each pretending to be a person. A multitude of United States patents are related to social media, growing rapidly.[citation needed]As of 2020[update], over 5000 social media patent applications had been published in the United States.[40]Only slightly over 100 patents had been issued.[41]  As an instance oftechnological convergence, various social media platforms adapted functionality beyond their original scope, increasingly overlapping with each other. Examples are the social hub siteFacebooklaunching an integratedvideo platformin May 2007,[42]andInstagram, whose original scope was low-resolution photo sharing, introducing the ability to share quarter-minute 640×640 pixel videos[43](late extended to a minute with increased resolution). Instagram later implementedstories(short videos self-destructing after 24 hours), a concept popularized bySnapchat, as well asIGTV, for seekable videos.[44]Stories were then adopted byYouTube.[45] X, whose original scope was text-based microblogging, later adopted photo sharing,[46]then video sharing,[47][48]then a media studio for business users, after YouTube's Creator Studio.[49] The discussion platformRedditadded an integratedimage hosterreplacing the external image sharing platformImgur,[50]and then an internal video hosting service,[51]followed by image galleries (multiple images in a single post), known from Imgur.[52]Imgur implemented video sharing.[53][54] YouTuberolled out a Community feature, for sharing text-only posts andpolls.[55] According toStatista, it is estimated that, in 2022, around 3.96 billion people were using social media globally. This number is up from 3.6 billion in 2020.[56] The following is a list of the most popularsocial networking servicesbased on the number of active users as of January 2024[update]perStatista.[57] A 2009 study suggested that individual differences may help explain who uses social media:extraversionandopennesshave a positive relationship with social media, whileemotional stabilityhas a negative sloping relationship with social media.[59]A 2015 study reported that people with a highersocial comparisonorientation appear to use social media more heavily than people with low social comparison orientation.[60] Common Sense Mediareported that children under age 13 in the United States usesocial networking servicesdespite the fact that many social media sites require users to be 13 or older.[61]In 2017, the firm conducted a survey of parents of children from birth to age 8 and reported that 4% of children at this age used social media sites such as Instagram, Snapchat, or (now-defunct)Musical.ly\"often\" or \"sometimes\".[62]Their 2019 survey surveyed Americans ages 8–16 and reported that about 31% of children ages 8–12 use social media.[63]In that survey, teens aged 16–18 were asked when they started using social media. the median age was 14, although 28% said they started to use it before reaching 13. Social media played a role in communication during theCOVID-19 pandemic.[64]In June 2020, a survey byCartoon Networkand the Cyberbullying Research Center surveyed Americanstweens(ages 9–12) and reported that the most popular application wasYouTube(67%).[65](as age increased, tweens were more likely to have used social media apps and games.) Similarly, Common Sense Media's 2020 survey of Americans ages 13–18 reported that YouTube was the most popular (used by 86% of 13- to 18-year-olds).[66]As children aged, they increasingly utilized social media services and often used YouTube to consume content. While adults were using social media before theCOVID-19 pandemic, more started using it to stay socially connected and to get pandemic updates. \"Social media have become popularly use to seek for medical information and have fascinated the general public to collect information regarding corona virus pandemics in various perspectives. During these days, people are forced to stay at home and the social media have connected and supported awareness and pandemic updates.\"[67] Healthcare workersand systems became more aware of social media as a place people were getting health information: \"During the COVID-19 pandemic, social media use has accelerated to the point of becoming a ubiquitous part of modern healthcare systems.\"[68] This also led to the spread ofdisinformation. On December 11, 2020, theCDCput out a \"Call to Action: Managing theInfodemic\".[69]Some healthcare organizations used hashtags as interventions and published articles on theirXdata:[70] \"Promotion of the joint usage of #PedsICU and #COVID19 throughout the international pediatric critical care community in tweets relevant to the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic and pediatric critical care.\"[70] However others in the medical community were concerned about social media addiction, as it became an increasingly important context and therefore \"source of social validation and reinforcement\" and were unsure whether increased social media use was harmful.[71] Governments may use social media to (for example):[72] Social media has been used extensivelyin civil and criminal investigations.[74]It has also been used to search for missing persons.[75]Police departments often make use of official social media accounts to engage with the public, publicize police activity, and burnish law enforcement's image;[76][77]conversely, video footage of citizen-documentedpolice brutalityand othermisconducthas sometimes been posted to social media.[77] In the United States,U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcementidentifies and track individuals via social media, and has apprehended some people via social media-based sting operations.[78]U.S. Customs and Border Protection(also known as CPB) and theUnited States Department of Homeland Securityuse social media data as influencing factors during thevisaprocess, and monitor individuals after they have entered the country.[79]CPB officers have also been documented performing searches of electronics and social media behavior at the border, searching both citizens and non-citizens without first obtaining a warrant.[79] As social media gained momentum among the younger generations, governments began using it to improve their image, especially among the youth. In January 2021, Egyptian authorities were reported to be usingInstagraminfluencers as part of its media ambassadors program. The program was designed to revampEgypt's image and to counter the bad press Egypt had received because of the country'shuman rightsrecord. Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates participated in similar programs.[80]Similarly, Dubai has extensively relied on social media and influencers to promote tourism. However, Dubai laws have kept these influencers within limits to not offend the authorities, or to criticize the city, politics or religion. The content of these foreign influencers is controlled to make sure that nothing portrays Dubai in a negative light.[81] Business uses social media formarketing,branding,[82]advertising, communication,sales promotions, informalemployee-learning/organizational development, competitive analysis, recruiting, relationship management/loyalty programs,[27]ande-Commerce. Companies usesocial-media monitoringtools to monitor, track, and analyze conversations to aid in their marketing, sales and other programs. Tools range from free, basic applications to subscription-based, tools. Social media offers information on industry trends. Within the finance industry, companies use social media as a tool for analyzing market sentiment. These range from marketing financial products, market trends, and as a tool to identify insider trading.[83]To exploit these opportunities, businesses need guidelines for use on each platform.[3] Business use of social media is complicated by the fact that the business does not fully control its social media presence. Instead, it makes its case by participating in the \"conversation\".[84]Business uses social media[85]on a customer-organizational level; and an intra-organizational level. Social media can encourage entrepreneurship and innovation, by highlighting successes, and by easing access to resources that might not otherwise be readily available/known.[86] Social media marketing can help promote a product or service and establish connections with customers. Social media marketing can be divided into paid media, earned media, and owned media.[87]Using paid social media firms run advertising on a social media platform. Earned social media appears when firms do something that impresses stakeholders and they spontaneously post content about it. Owned social media is the platform markets itself by creating/promoting content to its users.[88] Primary uses are to createbrand awareness, engage customers by conversation (e.g., customers provide feedback on the firm) and providing access tocustomer service.[89]Social media's peer-to-peer communication shifts power from the organization to consumers, since consumer content is widely visible and not controlled by the company.[90] Social media personalities, often referred to as \"influencers\", are internet celebrities who aresponsoredby marketers to promote products and companies online. Research reports that theseendorsementsattract the attention of users who have not settled on which products/services to buy,[91]especiallyyounger consumers.[92]The practice of harnessing influencers to market or promote a product or service to their following is commonly referred to asinfluencer marketing. In 2013, the United KingdomAdvertising Standards Authority(ASA) began advising celebrities to make it clear whether they had been paid to recommend a product or service by using the hashtag #spon or #ad when endorsing. The USFederal Trade Commissionissued similar guidelines.[93] Social media platforms also enabletargeting specific audiences with advertising. Users of social media can share, and comment on the advertisement, turning passive consumers into active promoters and even producers.[94]Targeting requires extra effort by advertisers to understand how to reach the right users.[3]Companies can use humor (such asshitposting) to poke fun at competitors.[95]Advertising can even inspirefanartwhich can engage new audiences.[96]Hashtags(such as #ejuice and #eliquid) are one way to target interested users.[97] User content can triggerpeer effects, increasing consumer interest even without influencer involvement. A 2012 study focused on this communication reported that communication among peers can affect purchase intentions: direct impact through encouraging conformity, and an indirect impact by increasing product engagement. This study claimed that peer communication about a product increased product engagement.[98] Social media have a range of uses inpolitics.[99]Politicians use social media to spread their messages andinfluence voters.[100] Dounoucos et al. reported that X use by candidates was unprecedented during the US' 2016 election.[101][102]The public increased its reliance on social-media sites for political information.[101]In theEuropean Union, social media amplified political messages.[103]Foreign-originated social-media campaigns attempt to influence political opinion in another country.[104][105][106] Social media was influential in theArab Springin 2011.[107][108][109][110]However, debate persists about the extent to which social media facilitated this.[111]Activists have used social media to report the abuse ofhuman rights in Bahrain. They publicized the brutality of government authorities, who they claimed weredetaining,torturingand threatening individuals. Conversely, Bahrain's government used social media to track and target activists. The government stripped citizenship from over 1,000 activists as punishment.[112] Militantgroups use social media as an organizing and recruiting tool.[113]Islamic State(also known as ISIS) used social media. In 2014, #AllEyesonISIS went viral on Arabic X.[114][115] Social media use in hiringrefers to the examination by employers ofjob applicants' (public) social media profiles as part of thehiringassessment. For example, the vast majority ofFortune 500companies use social media as a tool to screen prospective employees and as a tool for talent acquisition.[116] This practice raises ethical questions. Employers and recruiters note that they have access only to information that applicants choose to make public. Many Western-European countries restrict employer's use of social media in the workplace. States including Arkansas, California, Colorado, Illinois, Maryland, Michigan, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, Utah, Washington, and Wisconsin protect applicants and employees from surrendering usernames and passwords for social media accounts.[citation needed]Use of social media as caused significant problems for some applicants who are active on social media. A 2013 survey of 17,000 young people in six countries found that one in ten people aged 16 to 34 claimed to have been rejected for a job because of social media activity.[117][118] Scientists use social media to share their scientific knowledge and research on platforms such asResearchGate, LinkedIn, Facebook, X, andAcademia.edu.[119]The most common platforms are X and blogs. The use of social media reportedly has improved the interaction between scientists, reporters, and the general public.[citation needed]Over 495,000 opinions were shared on X related to science between September 1, 2010, and August 31, 2011.[120]Science related blogs respond to and motivate public interest in learning, following, and discussing science. Posts can be written quickly and allow the reader to interact in real time with authors.[121]One study in the context of climate change reported that climate scientists and scientific institutions played a minimal role in online debate, exceeded bynongovernmental organizations.[122] Academicians use social media activity to assessacademic publications,[123]to measure public sentiment,[124]identify influencer accounts,[125]or crowdsource ideas or solutions.[126] In some places, students have been forced to surrender their social media passwords to school administrators.[127]Few laws protect student's social media privacy. Organizations such as theACLUcall for more privacy protection. They urge students who are pressured to give up their account information to resist.[128] Colleges and universities may access applicants' internet services including social media profiles as part of their admissions process. According toKaplan, Inc, a corporation that provides higher education preparation, in 2012 27% of admissions officers usedGoogleto learn more about an applicant, with 26% checking Facebook.[129]Students whose social media pages include questionable material may be disqualified from admission processes. \"One survey in July 2017, by the American Association of College Registrars and Admissions Officers, reported that 11 percent of respondents said they had refused to admit an applicant based on social media content. This includes 8 percent of public institutions, where the First Amendment applies. The survey reported that 30 percent of institutions acknowledged reviewing the personal social media accounts of applicants at least some of the time.\"[130] Social media comments and images have been used in court cases including employment law, child custody/child support, and disability claims. After an Apple employee criticized his employer on Facebook, he was fired. When the former employee sued Apple for unfair dismissal, the court, after examining the employee's Facebook posts, reported in favor of Apple, stating that the posts breached Apple's policies.[131]After a couple broke up, the man posted song lyrics \"that talked about fantasies of killing the rapper's ex-wife\" and made threats. A court reported him guilty.[131][clarification needed]In a disability claims case, a woman who fell at work claimed that she was permanently injured; the employer used her social media posts to counter her claims.[131] Courts do not always admit social media evidence, in part, because screenshots can be faked or tampered with.[132]Judges may consideremojisinto account to assess statements made on social media; in one Michigan case where a person alleged that another person had defamed them in an online comment, the judge disagreed, noting that an emoji after the comment that indicated that it was a joke.[132]In a 2014 case in Ontario against a police officer regarding alleged assault of a protester during the G20 summit, the court rejected the Crown's application to use a digital photo of the protest that was anonymously posted online, because it included nometadataverifying its provenance.[132] Social media as a news sourceis the use of online social media platforms rather than moreovertraditional media platformsto obtain news. Just as television turned a nation of people wholistenedto media content intowatchersof media content in the 1950s to the 1980s, the emergence of social media has created a nation of mediacontent creators. Almost half of Americans use social media as a news source, according to the Pew Research Center.[133] As a participatory platform that allows foruser-generated content[134][135]and sharing content within one's own virtual network,[136][134]using social media as a news source allows users to engage with news in a variety of ways,[137]including: Using social media as a news source has become an increasingly more popular way for old and young adults alike to obtain information. There are ways that social media positively affects the world of news and journalism but it is important to acknowledge that there are also ways in which social media has a negative effect on the news that people consume such as false news, biased news, and disturbing content. Social media are used to socialize with friends and family[140]pursue romance and flirt,[140]but not all social needs can be fulfilled by social media.[141]For example, a 2003 article reported that lonely individuals are more likely to use the Internet for emotional support than others.[142]A 2018 survey from Common Sense Media reported that 40% of American teens ages 13–17 thought that social media was \"extremely\" or \"very\" important for them to connect with their friends.[143]The same survey reported that 33% of teens said social media was extremely or very important to conduct meaningful conversations with close friends, and 23% of teens said social media was extremely or very important to document and share their lives.[143]A 2020 Gallup poll reported that 53% of adult social media users in the United States thought that social media was a very or moderately important way to keep in touch with people during theCOVID-19 pandemic.[144] InAlone TogetherSherry Turkleconsidered how people confuse social media usage with authentic communication.[145]She claimed that people act differently online and are less concerned about hurting others' feelings. Some online encounters can cause stress and anxiety, due to the difficulty purging online posts, fear of getting hacked, or of universities and employers exploring social media pages. Turkle speculated that many people prefer texting to face-to-face communication, which can contribute to loneliness.[145]Surveys from 2019 reported evidence among teens in the United States[143]and Mexico.[146]Some researchers reported that exchanges that involved direct communication and reciprocal messages correlated with less loneliness.[147] In social media \"stalking\" or \"creeping\" refers to looking at someone's \"timeline, status updates, tweets, and online bios\" to find information about them and their activities.[148]A sub-category of creeping is creeping ex-partners after a breakup.[149] Catfishing(creating a false identity) allows bad actors to exploit the lonely.[150] Self-presentation theoryproposes that people consciously manage theirself-imageor identity related information in social contexts.[151]One aspect of social media is the time invested in customizing a personal profile.[152]Some users segment their audiences based on the image they want to present, pseudonymity and use of multiple accounts on the same platform offer that opportunity.[153] A 2016 study reported that teenage girls manipulate their self-presentation on social media to appear beautiful as viewed by their peers.[154]Teenage girls attempt to earn regard and acceptance (likes, comments, and shares). When this does no go well, self-confidence and self-satisfaction can decline.[154]A 2018 survey of American teens ages 13–17 by Common Sense Media reported that 45% said likes are at least somewhat important, and 26% at least somewhat agreed that they feel bad about themselves if nobody responds to their photos.[143]Some evidence suggests that perceived rejection may lead to emotional pain,[155]and some may resort to online bullying.[156]according to a 2016 study, users' reward circuits in their brains are more active when their photos are liked by more peers.[157] A 2016 review concluded that social media can trigger a negative feedback loop of viewing and uploading photos, self-comparison, disappointment, and disordered body perception when social success is not achieved.[158]One 2016 study reported that Pinterest is directly associated with disordered dieting behavior.[159] People portray themselves on social media in the most appealing way.[154]However, upon seeing one person's curated persona, other people may question why their own lives are not as exciting or fulfilling. One 2017 study reported that problematic social media use (i.e., feeling addicted to social media) was related to lower life satisfaction and self-esteem.[160]Studies have reported that social media comparisons can have dire effects on physical and mental health.[161][162]In one study, women reported that social media was the most influential source of their body image satisfaction; while men reported them as the second biggest factor.[163]While monitoring the lives of celebrities long predates social media, the ease and immediacy of direct comparisons of pictures and stories with one's own may increase their impact. A 2021 study reported that 87% of women and 65% of men compared themselves to others on social media.[164] Efforts to combat such negative effects focused promotingbody positivity. In a related study, women aged 18–30 were reported posts that contained side-by-side images of women in the same clothes and setting, but one image was enhanced for Instagram, while the other was an unedited, \"realistic\" version. Women who participated in this experiment reported a decrease in body dissatisfaction.[165] Social media can offer a support system for adolescent health, because it allows them to mobilize around health issues that they deem relevant.[166]For example, in a clinical study among adolescent patients undergoingobesitytreatment, participants' claimed that social media allowed them to access personalizedweight-losscontent as well as social support among other adolescents with obesity.[167][168] While social media can provide health information, it typically has no mechanism for ensuring the quality of that information.[168]TheNational Eating Disorders Associationreported a high correlation between weight loss content and disorderly eating among women who have been influenced by inaccurate content.[168][169]Health literacyoffers skills to allow users to spot/avoid such content. Efforts by governments and public health organizations to advance health literacy reportedly achieved limited success.[170] Social media such aspro-anorexiasites reportedly increase risk of harm by reinforcing damaging health-related behaviors through social media, especially among adolescents.[171][172][173] During the coronavirus pandemic, inaccurate information from all sides spread widely via social media.[174]Topics subject to distortion included treatments, avoiding infection, vaccination, and public policy. Simultaneously, governments and others influenced social media platforms to suppress both accurate and inaccurate information in support of public policy.[175]Heavier social media use was reportedly associated with more acceptance of conspiracy theories, leading to worse mental health[176]and less compliance with public health recommendations.[177] Social media platforms can serve as a breeding ground for addiction-related behaviors, with studies report that excessive use can lead to addiction-like symptoms. These symptoms include compulsive checking, mood modification, and withdrawal when not using social media, which can result in decreased face-to-face social interactions and contribute to the deterioration of interpersonal relationships and a sense of loneliness.[178] Journalistic influence has grown less important with the rise of social media, whereas social networking sites such asFacebook,YouTubeandX, provide an alternative supply of news sources. Further, many users offer their own narratives about events, complicating the process of unearthing the truth.[179][180]An example of this is the response to theTrayvon Martin shooting. Media coverage of the incident was minimal until social media users elevated it. Only a month later, online coverage attracted national coverage frommainstream media.[181] A 2017 study reported on a link between sleep disturbance and the use of social media. It concluded that blue light from computer/phone displays—and the frequency rather than the duration of time spent, predicted disturbed sleep, termed \"obsessive 'checking'\".[185]The association between social media use and sleep disturbance has clinical ramifications for young adults.[186]A recent study reported that people in the highest quartile for weekly social media use experienced the most sleep disturbance. The median number of minutes of social media use per day was 61. Females were more likely to experience high levels of sleep disturbance.[187]Many teenagers suffer from sleep deprivation from long hours at night on their phones, and this left them tired and unfocused in school.[188]A 2011 study reported that time spent on Facebook was negatively associated withGPA, but the association with sleep disturbance was not established.[189] One studied effect of social media is 'Facebook depression', which affects adolescents who spend too much time on social media.[8]This may lead to reclusiveness, which can increase loneliness and low self-esteem.[8]Social media curates content to encourage users to keep scrolling.[186]Studies report children's self-esteem is positively affected by positive comments and negatively affected by negative or lack of comments. This affected self-perception.[190]A 2017 study of almost 6,000 adolescent students reported that those who self-reported addiction-like symptoms of social media use were more likely to report low self-esteem and high levels of depressive symptoms.[191] A second emotional effect is social media burnout, defined as ambivalence, emotional exhaustion, anddepersonalization. Ambivalence is confusion about the benefits from using social media. Emotional exhaustion is stress from using social media. Depersonalization is emotional detachment from social media. The three burnout factors negatively influence the likelihood of continuing on social media.[192] A third emotional effect is \"fear of missing out\" (FOMO), which is the \"pervasive apprehension that others might be having rewarding experiences from which one is absent.\"[193]It is associated with increased scrutiny of friends on social media.[193] Social media can also offer support asXhas done for the medical community.[194]X facilitated academic discussion among health professionals and students, while providing a supportive community for these individuals by and allowing members to support each other through likes, comments, and posts.[195]Access to social media offered a way to keep older adults connected, after the deaths of partners and geographical distance between friends and loved ones.[196] Thedigital divideis the unequal access todigital technology, including smartphones, tablets, laptops, and the internet.[197][198]The digital divide worsens inequality around access to information and resources. In theInformation Age, people without access to the Internet and other technology are at a disadvantage, for they are unable or less able to connect with others, find and apply for jobs, shop, and learn.[197][199] According to thePew Research Centerand others, a majority of Americans at least occasionally receive news from social media.[204][205]Because ofrecommendation algorithmsthat filter and display news content that matches users' political preferences, one potential impact is an increase inpolitical polarizationdue toselective exposure. Political polarization is the divergence of political attitudes towardsideologicalextremes. Selective exposure occurs when an individual favors information that supports their beliefs and avoids information that conflicts with them. A 2016 study of U.S. elections revealed gender differences in the political use of X between candidates.[206]On social media women discuss policy issues at a higher rate than males. The study concluded that an increase in female candidates correlated to an increase in the amount of attention paid to policy issues, potentially heightening polarization.[207] Efforts to combat selective exposure may increase political polarization. A study examining X activity paid Democrat and Republican participants to follow X users whose content was different from their political beliefs (Republicans received liberal content and Democrats received conservative content) over a six-week period.[208]At the end of the study, bothDemocratandRepublicanparticipants were reported to have increased political polarization in favor of their own parties, though only Republican participants had an increase that was statistically significant.[208] Though some research reported that social media increases political polarization, others reported that social media can persuade users to change their beliefs.[209][210]A 2016 online survey of 1,024 U.S. users reported that individuals who use social media were more likely to have their political beliefs persuaded than those who did not. In particular, those using social media as a means to receive news were the most likely to change their beliefs.[209]The persuasion reported by participants was influenced by their exposure to diverse viewpoints, in content they saw as well as political discussions they participated in.[209]Another similar 2016 study conducted with 189 university students examined the persuasive effect of watching a political comedy video on Facebook, reporting that after watching comedian/political commentatorJohn Oliver, participants were likely to be persuaded to change their viewpoint on the topic (eitherpayday lendingor theFerguson protests) to one that was closer to Oliver.[210]The persuasive effect was reported to be reduced if they viewed comments by Facebook users that contradicted Oliver.[210] Research has also reported that social media use may not affect polarization at all.[211]A U.S. national survey of 1,032 participants reported that participants who used social media were more likely to be exposed to diverse people and opinions than others, although using social media was not correlated with a change in political polarization for these participants.[211] A 2017 study examining the potential polarizing effects of social media on the political views of its users suggested that a new way of engaging with social media must occur to avoid polarization.[212]The authors stated thatmedia literacy(described as methods that people can use to critique and create media) are valuable, and state that such skills must develop in order to be the most effective. In order to decrease polarization and encourage cooperation among social media users, Relevant skills included connecting with others in a caring way, embracing differences, and understanding the impact of social media on political, social, and cultural issues.[212] A 2018 study reported that social media increases the power of stereotypes.[213]Stereotypes can have both negative and positive connotations. For example, during the COVID-19 pandemic, youth were accused of responsibility for spreading the disease.[214]Elderly people get stereotyped as lacking knowledge of proper behavior on social media.[215] Social media allows for masscultural exchangeandintercultural communication, despite different ways of communicating in various cultures.[216] Social media has affected the way youth communicate, by introducing new forms of language.[217]Novel acronyms save time, as illustrated by \"LOL\", which is the ubiquitous shortcut for \"laugh out loud\". Thehashtagwas created to simplify searching for information and to allow users to highlight topics of interest in the hope of attracting the attention of others. Hashtags can be used to advocate for a movement, mark content for future use, and allow other users to contribute to a discussion.[218] For some young people, social media and texting have largely replaced in person communications, made worse by pandemic isolation, delaying the development of conversation and other social skills.[219] What is socially acceptable is now heavily based on social media.[220]TheAmerican Academy of Pediatricsreported that bullying, the making of non-inclusive friend groups, and sexual experimentation have increased cyberbullying, privacy issues, and sending sexual images or messages.Sextingandrevenge pornbecame rampant, particularly among minors, with legal implications and resulting trauma risk.[221][222][223][224]However, adolescents can learn basic social and technical skills online.[225]Social media, can strengthen relationships just by keeping in touch, making more friends, and engaging in community activities.[8] Historically, platforms were responsible for moderating the content that they presented. They set rules for what was allowable, decided which content to promote and which to ignore. The US enacted theCommunications Decency Actin 1996.Section 230of that act exempted internet platforms from legal liability for content authored by third parties. No provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be treated as the publisher or speaker of any information provided by another information content provider.\" (47 U.S.C. § 230(c)(1)). TheEuropean Unioninitially took a similar approach.[226]However, in 2020, theEuropean Commissionpresented two legislative proposals: TheDigital Services Act (DSA)and theDigital Markets Act (DMA). Both proposals were enacted in July 2022. The DSA entered into force on 17 February 2024, the DMA in March 2024.[227]This legislation can be summarized in the following four objectives, articulated byMEPs: Violators could face a complete ban in Europe or fines of up to 6% of global sales. Such content moderation requires extensive investment by platform providers.[230]Enforcement resources may not be sufficient to ensure compliance.[231] Tthe DSA allows a country to require information to be deleted that is illegal only in that jurisdiction.[232]For example, Hungary could require a video to be deleted that is in part critical of its government, but the video would then be unavailable in other EU countries as well. 2018 Nobel LaureatePaul Romer[233]advocated taxing negative externalities of social media platforms.[230]Similar to a carbon tax – negative social effects could be compensated for by a financial levy on the platforms.[234]Assuming that the tax did not deter the actions that produced the externalities, the revenue raised could be used to address them. However, consensus has yet to emerge on how to measure or mitigate the harms, nor to craft a tax, . Another proposal is to invokecompetition law.[235]The idea is to restrict the platforms' market power by controlling mergersex anteand tightening the law. This would be achieved through a supranational enforcement mechanism and the deterrent effect of high fines. The business model of most social media platforms is based on selling slots to advertisers. Platforms provide access to data about each user, which allows them to deliver adds that are individually relevant to them. This strongly incents platforms to arrange their content so that users view as much content as possible, increasing the number of ads that they see. Platforms such as X add paid user subscriptions in part to reduce their dependence on advertising revenues.[236] The enormous reach and impact of social media has naturally led to a stream of criticism, debate, and controversy. Criticisms include platform capabilities, content moderation and reliability,[237]impact on concentration, mental health,[238]content ownership, and the meaning of interactions, and poor cross-platforminteroperability,[239]decrease in face-to-face interactions,cyberbullying,sexual predation, particularly of children, andchild pornography.[240][241] In 2007Andrew Keenwrote, \"Out of this anarchy, it suddenly became clear that what was governing the infinite monkeys now inputting away on the Internet was the law of digital Darwinism, the survival of the loudest and most opinionated. Under these rules, the only way to intellectually prevail is by infinite filibustering.\"[242] Social media has become a regular source of news and information. A 2021 Pew Research Center poll reported roughly 70% of users regularly get news from social media,[4]despite the presence offake newsand misinformation. Platforms typically do not take responsibility for content accuracy, and many do not vet content at all, although in some cases, content the platform finds problematic is deleted or access to it is reduced.[243][244][245]Content distribution algorithms otherwise typically ignore substance, responding instead to the contents' virality. In 2018, researchers reported that fake news spread almost 70% faster than truthful news on X.[7]Social media bots on social media increase the reach of both true and false content and if wielded by bad actors misinformation can reach many more users.[10]Some platforms attempt to discover and block bots, with limited success.[11]Fake news seems to receive more user engagement, possibly because it is relatively novel, engaging users' curiosity and increasing spread.[23]Fake news often propagates in the immediate aftermath of an event, before conventional media are prepared to publish.[20][16] Social media miningis the process of obtaining data fromuser-generated contenton social media in order to extract actionable patterns, form conclusions about users, and act upon the information. Mining supports targeting advertising to users or academic research. The term is an analogy to the process ofminingfor minerals. Mining companies sift through raw ore to find the valuable minerals; likewise, social media mining sifts through social media data in order to discern patterns and trends about matters such as social media usage, online behaviour, content sharing, connections between individuals, buying behaviour. These patterns and trends are of interest to companies, governments and not-for-profit organizations, as such organizations can use the analyses for tasks such as design strategies, introduce programs, products, processes or services. Social media mining uses concepts fromcomputer science,data mining,machine learning, andstatistics. Mining is based onsocial network analysis,network science,sociology,ethnography, optimization and mathematics. It attempts to formally represent, measure and model patterns from social media data.[246]In the 2010s, major corporations, governments and not-for-profit organizations began mining to learn about customers, clients and others. Platforms such as Google, Facebook (partnered withDatalogixandBlueKai) conduct mining totarge users with advertising.[247]Scientists andmachine learningresearchers extract insights and design product features.[248] Users may not understand how platforms use their data.[249]Users tend to click throughTerms of Useagreements without reading them, leading to ethical questions about whether platforms adequately protect users' privacy. Malcolm Gladwellconsiders the role of social media in revolutions and protests to be overstated. He concluded that while social media makes it easier foractiviststo express themselves, that expression likely has no impact beyond social media. What he called \"high-risk activism\" involves strong relationships, coordination, commitment, high risks, and sacrifice.[251]Gladwell  claimed that social media are built around weak ties and argues that \"social networks are effective at increasing participation—by lessening the level of motivation that participation requires.\"[251]According to him, \"Facebook activism succeeds not by motivating people to make a real sacrifice, but by motivating them to do the things that people do when they are not motivated enough to make a real sacrifice.\"[251] Disputing Gladwell's theory, a 2018 survey reported that people who are politically expressive on social media are more likely to participate in offline political activity.[252] Social media content is generated by users. However, content ownership is defined by the Terms of Service to which users agree. Platforms control access to the content, and may make it available to third parties.[253] Although platform's terms differ, generally they all give permission to utilize users' copyrighted works at the platform's discretion.[254] After its acquisition by Facebook in 2012, Instagram revealed it intended to use content in ads without seeking permission from or paying its users.[255][256]It then reversed these changes, with then-CEOKevin Systrompromising to update the terms of service.[257][258] Privacy rights advocates warn users about the collection of their personal data. Information is captured without the user's knowingconsent. Data may be applied to law enforcement or other governmental purposes.[259][253]Information may be offered for third party use. Young people are prone to sharing personal information that can attract predators.[260] While social media users claim to want to keep their data private, their behavior does not reflect that concern, as many users expose significant personal data on their profiles. In addition, platforms collect data on user behaviors that are not part of their personal profiles. This data is made available to third parties for purposes that include targeted advertising.[261] A 2014Pew Research Centersurvey reported that 91% of Americans \"agree\" or \"strongly agree\" that people have lost control over how personal information is collected and used. Some 80% of social media users said they were concerned about advertisers and businesses accessing the data they share on social media platforms, and 64% said the government should do more to regulate advertisers.[262]In 2019, UK legislators criticized Facebook for not protecting certain aspects of user data.[263] In 2019 thePentagonissued guidance to the military, Coast Guard and other government agencies that identified \"the potential risk associated with using the TikTok app and directs appropriate action for employees to take in order to safeguard their personal information.\"[264]As a result, the military, Coast Guard,Transportation Security Administration, andDepartment of Homeland Securitybanned the installation and use of TikTok on government devices.[265] In 2020 The US government attempted to banTikTokandWeChatfrom the States over national security concerns. However, a federal court  blocked the move.[266]In 2024, the US Congress passed a low directing TikTok's parent companyByteDanceto divest the service or see the service banned from operating in the US. The company sued, challenging the constitutionality of the ban.[267] Internet addiction disorder(IAD), also known as problematic internet use or pathological internet use, is problematic, compulsive use of theinternet, particularly social media, that impairs individual function over a prolonged period of time. Young people are at particular risk of developing internet addiction disorder,[268]with case studies highlighting students whose academic performance declines as they spend more time online.[269]Some experience health consequences from loss of sleep[270]as they stay up to continue scrolling, chatting, and gaming.[271] Excessive Internet use is not recognized as a disorder by theWorld Health Organization, theDiagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5)or theInternational Classification of Diseases(ICD-11). However,gaming disorderappears in theICD-11. Controversy around the diagnosis includes whether the disorder is a separate clinical entity, or a manifestation of underlying psychiatric disorders. Definitions are not standardized or agreed upon, complicating the development of evidence-based recommendations. Users under 30 access the Internet more than other age groups and experience a higher risk of overuse.[272] In 2011 the term \"Facebook addiction disorder\" (FAD) emerged.[273]FAD is characterized by compulsive use ofFacebook. A 2017 study investigated a correlation between excessive use andnarcissism, reporting \"FAD was significantly positively related to the personality trait narcissism and to negative mental health variables (depression,anxiety, andstresssymptoms)\".[274][275] In 2020, the documentaryThe Social Dilemmareported the concerns of mental health experts and former employees of social media companies over social media's pursuit of addictive use. For example, when a user has not visited Facebook for some time, the platform varies its notifications, attempting to lure them back. It also raises concerns about the correlation between social media use and child and teen suicidality.[276] Whether to restrict the use of phones and social media among young people has been debated since smartphones became ubiquitous.[279]A study of Americans aged 12-15, reported that teenagers who used social media over three hours/day doubled their risk of negative mental health outcomes, including depression and anxiety.[280]Platforms have not tuned their algorithms to prevent young people from viewing inappropriate content. A 2023 study of Australian youth reported that 57% had seen disturbingly violent content, while nearly half had regular exposure to sexual images.[281]Further, youth are prone to misuse social media forcyberbullying. As result, phones have been banned from some schools, and some schools have blocked social media websites.[282]In 2024,Floridabanned the use of social media by minors.[283] Social media often features in political struggles. In some countries,Internet policeorsecret policemonitor or control citizens' use of social media. For example, in 2013 some social media was banned inTurkeyafter the TaksimGezi Park protests. Both X and YouTube were temporarily suspended in the country by a court's decision. A law granted immunity to Telecommunications Directorate (TİB) personnel. The TİB was also given the authority to block access to specific websites without a court order.[284]Yet TİB's 2014 blocking of X was ruled by the constitutional court to violate free speech.[285] In the2014 Thai coup d'état, the public was explicitly instructed not to 'share' or 'like' dissenting views on social media or face prison. In July of that year, in response toWikiLeaks' release of a secret suppression order made by theVictorian Supreme Court, media lawyers were quoted in theAustralianmedia to the effect that \"anyone who tweets a link to the WikiLeaks report, posts it on Facebook, or shares it in any way online could also face charges\".[286]On 27 July 2020, in Egypt, two women were sentenced to two years of imprisonment for postingTikTokvideos, which the government claims are \"violating family values\".[287] Internet censorshipin the United States is the suppression of information published or viewed on theInternet in the United States. TheFirst Amendment of the United States Constitutionprotectsfreedom of speechand expression against federal, state, and local government censorship. Free speech protections allow little government-mandated Internet content restrictions. However, the Internet is highly regulated, supported by a complex set of legally binding and privately mediated mechanisms.[288] Gambling, cyber security, and the dangers to children who frequent social media are important ongoing debates. Significant public resistance to proposed content restriction policies has prevented measures used in some other countries from taking hold in the US[288] Many government-mandated attempts to regulate content have been barred, often after lengthy legal battles.[289]However, the government has exerted pressure indirectly. With the exception ofchild pornography, content restrictions tend to rely on platforms to remove/suppress content, following state encouragement or the threat of legal action.[290][288] While the dominant social media platforms are not interoperable, open source protocols such asActivityPubhave been adopted by platforms such asMastodon,GNU social,Diaspora, andFriendica. They operate as a loose federation of mostly volunteer-operated servers, called theFediverse. However, in 2019, Mastodon blockedGabfrom connecting to it, claiming that it spread violent, right-wing extremism.[296] In December 2019, X CEOJack Dorseyadvocated an \"open and decentralized standard for social media\". He joinedBlueskyto bring it to reality.[297] Deplatforming, (no-platforming), a form of Internet censorship of an individual or group by preventing them from posting on the platforms they use to share their information/ideas. This typically involves suspension, outright bans, or reducing spread (shadow banning) .[298][299] According toLikeWar: The Weaponization of Social Media,[302]the use of effective social media marketing techniques includes not only celebrities, corporations, and governments, but also extremist groups.[303]The use of social media byISISandAl-Qaedahas been used to influence public opinion where it operates and gain the attention of sympathizers. Social media platforms and encrypted-messaging applications have been used to recruit members, both locally and internationally.[304]Platforms have endured backlash forallowing this content. Extreme nationalist groups, and more prominently, USright-wing extremists have used similar online tactics. As many traditional social media platforms bannedhate speech, several platforms became popular among right-wing extremists to carry out planning and communication including of events; these application became known as \"Alt-tech\". Platforms such asTelegram,Parler, andGabwere used during theJanuary 6 United States Capitol attack, to coordinate attacks.[305]Members shared tips on how to avoid law enforcement and their plans on carrying out their objectives; some users called for killing law enforcement officers and politicians.[306] Social media content, persists unless the user deletes it. After a user dies, unless the platform is notified, their content remains.[307]Each platform has created guidelines for this situation.[308]In most cases on social media, the platforms require a next-of-kin to prove that the user is deceased, and give them the option of closing the account or maintaining it in a 'legacy' status. facilitates the building of relations",
